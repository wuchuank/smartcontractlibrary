# Library of Smart Contracts

 This repo consists of smart contracts that I feel that I can learn something from, be it gas optimisations, security practices or mistakes in the contracts

These contracts are extracted from etherscan using foundry's command line tool cast, more specifically cast etherscan-source.

More information can be found on the [foundry book](book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-etherscan-source.html)
