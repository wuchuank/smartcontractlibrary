# Library of Smart Contracts

 This repo consists of smart contracts that I feel that I can learn something from, be it gas optimisations, security practices or mistakes in the contracts

These contracts are extracted from etherscan using a simple tool I developed called [ethersource](https://github.com/wuchuank/ethersource)
